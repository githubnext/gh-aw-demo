# Daily Closed Issues Report

Generate a comprehensive daily report of all issues closed in the past 24 hours in the repository ${{ github.repository }}.

## Your Task

1. **Search for closed issues**: Use the GitHub API to find all issues that were closed in the last 24 hours.
   - Use the search query to filter issues closed since yesterday
   - Include both manually closed and automatically closed issues

2. **Analyze the closed issues**: For each closed issue found:
   - Note the issue number and title
   - Identify who closed it
   - Check if it was linked to a pull request
   - Categorize by labels if present (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)

3. **Generate a summary report**: Create a well-formatted report that includes:
   - Total number of issues closed in the past 24 hours
   - Breakdown by category/label
   - List of closed issues with their titles and links
   - Key contributors who closed issues
   - Any notable patterns or trends

4. **Create an issue with the report**: Use the safe-outputs create-issue feature to post your daily report as a new issue.
   - Title should be clear and include the date
   - Body should be well-formatted markdown with sections
   - Include links to all closed issues
   - Add a summary at the top

## Output Format

Your report should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Daily Closed Issues Report - [Date]

## Summary
- **Total Issues Closed**: [number]
- **Reporting Period**: [timeframe]

## Breakdown by Category
- Bugs: [count]
- Enhancements: [count]

- Other: [count]

## Closed Issues

### Bugs
1. #[number] - [title] - closed by @[username]
